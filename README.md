# Real Time Traffic Information Sharing Between Autonomous Vehicles
## Overview
The current detection system used by autonomous vehicles, which relies on their own camera and radar, does not make good advantage of the vehicle-to-vehicle network and thus is inefficient. With inter-vehicle network, vehicles can share traffic information more efficiently to improve their performance and prevent potential accidents. Sharing real-time data between vehicles on the road will  also reduce delays and speed up traffic safely.

Research has been done on constructing a network of cars. Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is proposed to connect moving cars as nodes in a wireless network. This network investigates the vehicle-to vehicle (V2V) aspect of the road network system to improve transportation operations [1]. However, this technique will require car computers to support network connection [2], which is not yet completely achieved. 

## Methodologies and Evaluation
The plan is to build a new peer-to-peer protocol based on the current application layer in the networks. It will be an overlay on the existing mobile networks but with better adaptability to fit the special requirements of running environment of self-driving vehicles. The final deliverable outcome of this project will be represented in an emulation prototype. The expected result varies depending on the actual process of this project.
